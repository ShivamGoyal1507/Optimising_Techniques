# 📊 Operations Research Methods in C++

## 🧠 Overview
This C++ program implements six essential Operations Research (OR) algorithms, widely used in optimization and decision science:

- **Simplex Method** for Linear Programming (LP)
- **Dual Simplex Method**
- **Assignment Problem** (Hungarian Algorithm)
- **Transportation Problem** (Vogel’s Approximation Method)
- **Integer Programming (IP)**
- **Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)**

Each algorithm is modularized in its own header file for clarity and reusability.

## ✨ Features

- ✔️ **Simplex Method** – Solves LP problems in standard form  
- ✔️ **Dual Simplex Method** – Solves LP problems with infeasible starting points  
- ✔️ **Hungarian Algorithm** – Solves optimal assignment of workers to tasks  
- ✔️ **Vogel’s Approximation Method (VAM)** – Provides initial feasible solution for transportation problems  
- ✔️ **Integer Programming (IP)** – Solves optimization problems with integer constraints using **Branch and Bound**  
- ✔️ **Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)** – Handles problems with both integer and real variables  
- ✔️ **Binary Variable Support** – Implicitly handled through constraints  
- ✔️ **Interactive Menu Interface** – Simple command-line navigation  
- ✔️ **Formatted Output** – Easy-to-read results for each method

## 📌 Method Details

### 1. Simplex Method
- Input: Number of variables and constraints  
- Enter each constraint (coefficients + RHS)  
- Define the objective function  
- Output: Optimal solution vector and objective value

---

### 2. Dual Simplex Method
- Similar to Simplex input  
- Used when initial basic solution is infeasible  
- Maintains dual feasibility while optimizing

---

### 3. Assignment Problem (Hungarian Algorithm)
- Input: Number of workers/tasks (`n`)  
- Enter a square `n × n` cost matrix  
- Output: Optimal assignment and minimum cost

---

### 4. Transportation Problem (Vogel’s Approximation Method)
- Input:
  - Number of sources and destinations  
  - Supply for each source  
  - Demand for each destination  
  - Cost matrix  
- Output: Initial feasible solution using VAM

---

### 5. Integer / Mixed Integer Programming (Branch and Bound)
- Input: Objective function and constraints  
- Specify which variables are integers or mixed  
- Binary variables handled via constraints  
- Solves using Branch and Bound method  
- Output: Optimal integer/mixed-integer solution
